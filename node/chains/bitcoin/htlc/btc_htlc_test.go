// There are two directions that the atomic swap can be performed, as the
// initiator can be on either chain.  This tool only deals with creating the
// Bitcoin transactions for these swaps.  A second tool should be used for the
// transaction on the other chain.  Any chain can be used so long as it supports
// OP_SHA256 and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
//
// Example scenerios using bitcoin as the second chain:
//
// Scenerio 1:
//   cp1 initiates (olt)
//   cp2 participates with cp1 H(S) (btc)
//   cp1 redeems btc revealing S
//     - must verify H(S) in contract is hash of known Secret
//   cp2 redeems olt with S
//
// Scenerio 2:
//   cp1 initiates (btc)
//   cp2 participates with cp1 H(S) (olt)
//   cp1 redeems olt revealing S
//     - must verify H(S) in contract is hash of known Secret
//   cp2 redeems btc with S
